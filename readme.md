# PeerPair

## Purpose
As you might guess from the name, Peerpair was created in order to create random pairings of people. However, this tool specifically provides the ability to do so when there is another criteria which you want to ensure is satisfied in the pairing. More specifically, if you want to limit certain matches, ensuring no one who shares a specified criteria, PeerPair provides this functionality.

## How to Use It
Peerpair reads a csv file for which each line contains exactly three values
* Name
* Email address
* Criteria

For the purposes of this document (and as the variable is notated in the code), we'll use "Organization". However, the third value, used as a differentiator, can be anything you want
